# SynMIC

SynMIC is a Kotlin 1.7 application that loads data from the Synonymous Mutations
in Cancer Database (http://synmicdb.dkfz.de/rsynmicdb/) into a local Neo4j 4 database.
The synonymous mutation data is intended to be incorporated into an existing 
COSMICGraphdb Neo4j database and is represented as new SynonymousMutation nodes.
